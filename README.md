## Context 

I have use Context API to make the data available to all components and to avoid prop drilling and avoided using Redux as it would be a overkill for this small application.

### Test Cases

`npm test` for running unit test cases

`npm test:cucumber` for running BDD tests

`npm run test:e2e` for E2E tests
