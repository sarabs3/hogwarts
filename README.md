### Local Setup

- Clone or Download the repo.
- Run `npm install` inside the directory.
- Run `npm start` to spin up the local dev setup.



#### Tasks

- [x] Created the UI
- [x] Attendance board for updating live attendace of the teacher
- [x] Current Schedule, getting populated by changing the attendance
- [x] Automatically find next available teacher and assign to the student
- [x] Mobile Responsive design
- [x] Unit Testing using Jest
- [x] BDD using CucumberJs 
- [x] E2E testing using CypressJs
- [x] Using Context API
- [x] Custom CSS
- [x] Handling both subject allocation (Potions Master and Defense Against the Dark Arts)

## Context 

I have use Context API to make the data available to all components and to avoid prop drilling and avoided using Redux as it would be a overkill for this small application.

### Test Cases

`npm test` for running unit test cases

`npm test:cucumber` for running BDD tests

`npm run test:e2e` for E2E tests
